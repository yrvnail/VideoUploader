    <documentation>The InvisibleMessage provides a way to programmatically expose dynamic content changes in a way
that can be announced by screen readers.

&lt;h3&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;
This class is a singleton. The class instance can be retrieved via the static method
{@link sap.ui.core.InvisibleMessage.getInstance}.

&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; Keep in mind that, according to the ARIA standard, the live regions should be presented
and should be empty. Thus, we recommend to instantiate &lt;code&gt;InvisibleMessage&lt;/code&gt; via
&lt;code&gt;sap.ui.core.InvisibleMessage.getInstance()&lt;/code&gt; as early as possible in the application logic,
e.g. with the Component initialization, with the main Controller initialization, after Core initialization, etc.
Then, you should specify the text that has to be announced by the screen reader and the live regionâ€™s mode
using the &lt;code&gt;announce&lt;/code&gt; method.</documentation>
